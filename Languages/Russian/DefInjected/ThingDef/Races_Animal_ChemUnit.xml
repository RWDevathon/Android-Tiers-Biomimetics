  <ATB_DroneChemUnit.description>A highly specialized intricate autonomous drone capable of identifying, seeking, and absorbing biological matter for processing into a synthetic chemical precursor to neutroamine or chemfuel. The process's order of operations lent itself well to shaping a machine in the form of a small bird, with the product outputted as a self-stored egg-like capsule.
